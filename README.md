The goal of this project is to develop a system that calculates precise measurements for sewing patterns based on individual body dimensions, ensuring a personalized fit for each user. By inputting specific body measurements, the system provides accurate data for pattern creation, facilitating the production of custom-fitted garments. This approach aims to enhance both bespoke tailoring and large-scale textile manufacturing by offering patterns that accommodate unique body shapes and sizes, thereby improving comfort and fit.

In future developments, the system will incorporate functionality to resize existing patterns, allowing for greater versatility in garment production.
