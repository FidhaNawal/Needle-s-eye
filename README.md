PROJECT DESCRIPTION


The goal of this project is to develop a system that calculates precise measurements for sewing patterns based on individual body dimensions, ensuring a personalized fit for each user. By inputting specific body measurements, the system provides accurate data for pattern creation, facilitating the production of custom-fitted garments. This approach aims to enhance both bespoke tailoring and large-scale textile manufacturing by offering patterns that accommodate unique body shapes and sizes, thereby improving comfort and fit.

In future developments, the system will incorporate functionality to resize existing patterns, allowing for greater versatility in garment production.

THE PROBLEM STATEMENT


Manual calculation of stitching patterns is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to inaccuracies in garment fitting. This project automates the process by generating precise sewing patterns along with corresponding measurements based on individual body dimensions, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and a personalized fit.

THE SOLUTION


This project proposes a measurement-based pattern generation system that allows users to input their specific body dimensions to create personalized sewing patterns. The system will:

1.Accurately Calculate Measurements – Convert body dimensions into precise pattern measurements.

2.Provide Patterns – Provide tailored patterns for various garment types.

3.Enhance Usability – Enable both individual users (home sewers, designers) and manufacturers to streamline the pattern-making process.

4.Future Expansion – Introduce resizing functionality to modify existing patterns, increasing efficiency and versatility in garment production.
